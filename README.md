# What is Q for Question?

Question.io is a tool that aims to facilitate communication between students and teachers in the classroom. It provides a platform for students to ask questions during class and for teachers to answer them. The tool allows teachers to start a session at the beginning of each class and moderate the questions asked by students. Students can login to the session and ask their questions anonymously or not. The goal of this tool is to create a more open and engaging learning environment in the classroom.
